* created project via vue cli. i personally know vue2, but for the sake of learning the changes, decided to use vue3
(`vue create`). chose npm as package manager. chose typescript.
* checked everything into local version control.
* created service that fetches all transactions and all cards.
* create basic card component.
* added vue router. in the meantime, saw that the property and class decorator i used in vue2 are not ready for vue3
 chose as UI framework  quasar, since its one of the popular choices and vuetify, which I known doesnt support vue3 yet. 
 Adding it via vue-cli was a hassle and made problems so i switched to element plus.
* npm init vue@3 with typescript support
* for testing i decided to use vitest since jest seems to be semi - supported and also
not very obvious how to set it up
